<h4 class="ng-binding">Why can't I wager more BTC?</h4>

<p class="ng-binding">The maximum bet is automatically adjusted by the system, according to the number of players playing concurrently, and the wager size for each individual player. There is only a limited pool of funds to back bets. If the system determines that the amount of bets placed has exceeded the immediate repayment capacity of the system - which can only be determined after a bet is placed but before a wager is processed - upon placing your bet, the amount wagered will be automatically returned to the players balance before evaluating for win or loss. The maximum allowed bet value is adjusted in real time, so you can try to bet again in a few minutes.</p><p></p>
