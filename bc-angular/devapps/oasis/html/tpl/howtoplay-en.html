    <h4>Playing Casino Oasis Poker</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            A single 52-card deck is used, consisting of the usual 52 cards.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Player makes an ante wager.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Player must fold or raise
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If player folds he forfeits his cards and ante bet.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If player raises then he must make a raise wager exactly equal to twice the ante.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The dealer will turn over his other four cards.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The dealer must have an ace and a king or higher to qualify. In other words, the lowest qualifying hand
            would be ace, king, 4, 3, 2 and the highest non-qualifying hand would be ace, queen, jack, 10, 9.
            If the dealer does not qualify the player will win even money on his ante wager and the raise will BE RETURNED.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the dealer qualifies and beats the player, both ante and raise will lose.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the dealer qualifies and loses to the player, then the ante will pay even money and the raise according
            to the posted pay table.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the player and dealer tie, both ante and raise will push.
        </p></li>
