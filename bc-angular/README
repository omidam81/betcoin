It covers tips that helped me to work in the project.
This guide is written by a starter to the project.

1) NodeJS issues
- Issue1: NPM's version should be higher than 1.4.6.
- Solution: You can install npm with the version 1.4.6 by following command.
	npm install npm@1.4.6 -g

- Issue2: While "npm update" is not updating all the required packages, it seems You don't have previllege to .npm folder.
- Solution: The chown command me helped for this issue. Thus as my user name is david, the following command obtains privillege to the .npm foler.
	chown -R david:david /home/david/.npm

2) Build issues
You can build node server by following command.
	node node/server --port 3002
	node node/server --loc zh_CN --port 3001 (for chinese version)
You can build apps by following commands.
	grunt --prod home 
	grunt --prod home --loc zh_CN
- Issue1: Currently app links on localhost redirect to product site link.
I.E. If You click conflip game on localhost, it redirects to betcoin.tm/conflip.
- Solution: You need to build conflip on localhost by following command.
	grunt --prod conflip
Then You can check the conflip at localhost/conflip

3) Login issues
In order to login sites You need to create betcoin wallet at https://blockchain.info/wallet/new.

3. push to your branch
4. create a pull request with Bitbucket
	(Target branch name is always "DEV". You need also to put your leader's full name as  reviewer's name )
