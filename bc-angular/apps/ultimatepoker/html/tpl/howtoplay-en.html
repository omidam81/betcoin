    <h4>Playing Ultimate Texas Hold'Em Poker</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            The game is played with a single ordinary 52-card deck.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The player must make an equal bet on both the Ante and Blind, and can also make an optional Trips bet.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Two cards are dealt to the player and dealer.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The player can check or make a Play bet equal to three or four times the Ante.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The dealer turns over three community cards.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the player previously checked, then he may make a Play bet equal to two times his Ante. If the player already made a Play bet, then he may not bet further.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Two final community cards are turned over.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the player previously checked twice, then he must either make a Play bet equal to exactly his Ante, or fold, losing both his Ante and Blind bets. If the player already raised he may not bet further.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The player and dealer will both make the best possible hand using any combination of their own two cards and the five community cards.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The dealer will need at least a pair to open.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The following table shows how the Blind, Ante, and Play bets are scored, according to who wins, and whether the dealer opens.
