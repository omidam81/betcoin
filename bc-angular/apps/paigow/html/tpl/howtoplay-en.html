  <h4>Playing Casino Pai Gow Poker</h4>
  <ol>
  <li><p>
  A single 53-card deck is used, consisting of the usual 52 cards, plus one joker.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
  The joker is semi-wild. It may be used as an ace, or to complete a straight, flush, or straight flush, or royal flush. After the player makes a bet, the dealer will deal the player and himself seven cards each.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
  The player need to separate his seven cards into a five-card high hand, and two-card low hand, by selecting the two cards to split. The high hand must be of higher poker value than the low hand.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
  The five-card hand is ranked according to conventional poker rules. The only poker hand in the two-card hand is a pair or no pair, after which the individual cards determine the value.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
  After the player has set his hand, the dealer will turn over his cards and divide his hand in the same manner, according to specified rules known as the "house way."
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    The player can choose to play the house way. This will automatically split the player's cards according the house rule.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
   The High hand of both the bank and the player will be compared after which the low hands will get evaluated. The best poker hand wins in both instances. If both the banker and player show the same hand the hand is awarded to the bank.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
  If the player wins both comparisons, then the player will win even money on his bet. If the player wins one and loses one, then the bet shall push. If the player loses or ties both, then the player shall lose his wager.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>Tampering and other fraudulent actions void all pays and plays.</p></li>
