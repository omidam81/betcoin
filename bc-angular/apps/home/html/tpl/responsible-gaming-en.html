<h1>Game Responsibly</h1>
<p>
BetCoin Entertainment SARL is taking a proactive approach to combat the social issues arising from problem gambling by launching a full Responsible Gambling Problem at the start of BetCoin™ operations. This program aims to provide information on problem gambling and teaches  our customer service team members how to direct users to obtain help. Gaming is a form of entertainment for adults only and persons under the age of 21 are prohibited from engaging in gaming activities. We optimize our Responsible Gaming Program through continuous partnership with experts, problem gambling prevention and treatment centers, education and community organizations, striving to effectively minimize gambling-related damage.
