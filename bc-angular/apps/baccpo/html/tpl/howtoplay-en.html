    <h4>Playing Casino Baccpo</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Cards are scored as in baccarat. In particular:
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Play starts with the player and dealer receiving two cards each. As in blackjack, one dealer card is turned face up and the other face down.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The player shall have the option to stand or take one more card.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            After the player has acted, the dealer turns over his other card. Then the dealer takes a third card if he has five or less points, or two threes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Hand scoring is generally the same as in baccarat, where the score is the terminal digit of the total number of points.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            In the event of a tie, the hand with three cards shall outrank a hand with two cards. Otherwise, two hands of the same number of points and cards shall tie.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The highest ranking hand is a 3-card 9 composed of three 3's.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            A player 3-3-3 hand shall automatically win, and pay 3 to 1.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Any winning player 7-point hand shall pay 1 to 2.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            All other player wins shall pay 1 to 1.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Any 9-point tie, with the same number of cards in both hands, will go to the player. All other ties shall push.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If the dealer has the higher hand, then the player shall lose.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Side bets are available on a tie and a Bonus Bet, which are explained below.
